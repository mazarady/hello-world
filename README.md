# hello-world

Hi my name is Maaz Munir, let me tell you a story. 

One day I was walking to my class which was on the opposite side of campus and I thought to myself, "Maaz do you really wanna go to class", so I turned around and went home....I got an A in that class

I'm a computer science major and minoring in conflict resolutions. "Why are you minoring in conflict resolution maaz"......"Because I wanna start conflicts and just leave"

THat's all. 

Enjoy my projects. Can't wait to work with ya'll. 
Kappa
Peace
